# WoD-L5R-Dice
WoD L5R Dice is a sadistic, whimsical and fickle, bot. With a penchant for drama, it is responsible for the death of countless PCs and derailment of countless plots. It also rolls dice according to the rules for various RPG systems and keeps track of certain stats such as HP, initiative scores, etc., as well as generates random characters for different systems, using their rules.

This bot was made for my own personal use and amusement! I am currently working to refactor its code so many of its original features are missing. As I am still learning, any critics and advice are welcome and appreciated!
